# Animal Flow Sequence Builder

## Description
This is an app, created using React JS, for designing Animal Flow sequences. It uses my [Animal Flow Moves API](https://github.com/steve-dave8/Animal-Flow-Moves-API) on the backend. 

### Features
* Over 100 movements

* For a selected movement a list of next possible movements will be provided from which you can pick your next move and repeat the process to build a flow

* Generate random flows

* Mirror your flows (swapping left/right)

* An index to look up moves individually

## Project Status
### Upcoming
* Options to filter next moves by level and component.
* Ongoing addition of movements to the backend.
