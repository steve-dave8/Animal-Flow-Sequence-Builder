# Animal Flow Sequence Builder

## Description
This is an app, created using React JS, for designing Animal Flow sequences. It uses my [Animal Flow Moves API](https://github.com/steve-dave8/Animal-Flow-Moves-API) on the backend. 

### Features
* For a selected movement a list of next possible movements will be provided from which you can pick your next move and repeat the process to build a flow. 

## Project Status

### Current
(August 16, 2021) - The app is now connected to the backend to pull data on Animal Flow movements. I also adjusted the home page to account for more complex movements that have aliases and precursors.

### Upcoming
* Function to generate random flows.
* Ongoing addition of movements to the backend.
